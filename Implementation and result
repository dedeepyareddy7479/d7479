Implementation is one of the phases of the Software Development life 
Cycle. The implementation phase of software development involves 
translation of design specifications source code and debugging, 
documentation and unit testing of the source code. 
Majority of symptoms of driver fatigue will be reflected through eyes. 
Based on the symptoms related to face and eye region it is detected 
whether person is drowsy or not. 
In our proposed system, we focus mainly on eye localization. 
Detection process has four steps:
1. Face detection 
2. Eye detection 
3. Iris detection 
4. Drowsiness Detection

##Explanation of Key functions 
Python: Python is the basis of the program that we wrote. It utilizes many of the python libraries. 
 Libraries: 
1. NumPy: Pre-requisite for Dlib 
2.SciPy: Used for calculating Euclidean distance between the 
eyelids. 
3. Playsound: Used for sounding the alarm 
4.Dlib: This program is used to find the frontal human face and 
estimate its pose using 68 face landmarks 
5.Imutils: Convenient functions written for Opencv.
6. Opencv: Used to get the video stream from the webcam, etc. 
 OS: Program is tested on Windows 10 build 1903 and PopOS 
7.Laptop: Used to run our code. 
8. Webcam: Used to get the video feed
